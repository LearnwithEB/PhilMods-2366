[{"description":"Create an immersive 3D scrollytelling portfolio called 'Go Mods' with React Three Fiber and GSAP. The site should feature: 1) A gamified loading state with 'INITIALIZING GO MODS PROTOCOL...' text and boot-up animation, with a 'Start System' button that triggers camera zoom into the scene. 2) Hero section with a 3D floating workbench in a dark void, featuring a holographic emitter projecting a rotating wireframe, with bold 'GO MODS' typography and subtitle 'Innovative 3D Modeling & Animation / Ready for the Metaverse'. 3) Scrollytelling projects tunnel where camera flies forward through void as user scrolls, with floating virtual screens passing by showing: Character Rigs, Environment Design, and Process & Topology sections. 4) About console section styled as a command terminal with text 'Mission: Bringing ideas to life through innovative 3D creation' and a 'Nostalgia Mode' toggle that switches terminal colors between green and pink. 5) Permanent 'STATUS: ONLINE / OPEN TO COMMISSION' beacon in top-right corner with pulsing green dot that expands on hover to show email mcrevatis03@gmail.com. Design aesthetic: Deep Void Purple (#1a0b2e) background with Terminal Green (#00ff41) accents, industrial sci-fi vibe inspired by Glitch Productions. Optimize for 60FPS performance with mobile fallback.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1}]
