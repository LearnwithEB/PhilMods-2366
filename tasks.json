[{"description":"Create an immersive 3D scrollytelling portfolio called 'Go Mods' with React Three Fiber and GSAP. The site should feature: 1) A gamified loading state with 'INITIALIZING GO MODS PROTOCOL...' text and boot-up animation, with a 'Start System' button that triggers camera zoom into the scene. 2) Hero section with a 3D floating workbench in a dark void, featuring a holographic emitter projecting a rotating wireframe, with bold 'GO MODS' typography and subtitle 'Innovative 3D Modeling & Animation / Ready for the Metaverse'. 3) Scrollytelling projects tunnel where camera flies forward through void as user scrolls, with floating virtual screens passing by showing: Character Rigs, Environment Design, and Process & Topology sections. 4) About console section styled as a command terminal with text 'Mission: Bringing ideas to life through innovative 3D creation' and a 'Nostalgia Mode' toggle that switches terminal colors between green and pink. 5) Permanent 'STATUS: ONLINE / OPEN TO COMMISSION' beacon in top-right corner with pulsing green dot that expands on hover to show email mcrevatis03@gmail.com. Design aesthetic: Deep Void Purple (#1a0b2e) background with Terminal Green (#00ff41) accents, industrial sci-fi vibe inspired by Glitch Productions. Optimize for 60FPS performance with mobile fallback.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1},{"description":"Update all branding from 'Go Mods' to 'PhillMods'.

The 3D wireframe should progressively fill with texture/color as user scrolls. Add parallax effect with wireframe rotating on Y-axis during scroll. Include custom neon green crosshair cursor, floating particle system with green code snippets/vertices in background. Update hero text to: 'PHILLMODS - Innovative 3D Modeling & Animation - Ready for the Metaverse'. Add glowing green outlined 'COMMISSION TODAY' button with subtle pulse animation.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":3},{"description":"ACT 2 - THE CREATIVE VOID: Transform project section into floating 'Project Capsules' drifting through space at varying depths and speeds. Each capsule should use glass-morphism design containing: rotating 3D model preview, project title in terminal green, tech specs like 'Blender | Unreal Engine | Game-Ready'. On hover: capsule slows rotation, enlarges 10%, green glow intensifies. On click: expand to full-screen modal with high-res rotating 3D viewer, wireframe toggle switch, project breakdown showing 'Polycount | Textures | Rigged'. Include 4 projects: 'Goat Character V1' (wireframe and textured), 'Environment Pack', 'Character Rigging Demo', 'Unreal Engine Real-Time Rendering'. Add floating badges that drift by: 'UNREAL ENGINE CERTIFIED', 'CLEAN TOPOLOGY SPECIALIST', 'GAME-READY ASSETS', 'PBR TEXTURING EXPERT'.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":4},{"description":"ACT 3 - OPEN NETWORK: Create holographic terminal interface for contact section. Add grid floor with neon green wireframe grid materializing beneath. Central holographic display shows status: 'STATUS: ONLINE | OPEN TO COMMISSION' with pulsing green beacon. Contact section includes Discord: @pheliabobelia with logo, email form with terminal aesthetic, and 'Response Time: 24-48 HR TURNAROUND'.

Add PROCESS VIEWER: Timeline slider showing model evolution from Concept Sketch → Blockout → Wireframe → Textured → Final Render that users can scrub through. Add REAL-TIME STATS DASHBOARD with live counters: 'Projects Completed: 47', 'Total Vertices Modeled: 2.4M', 'Coffee Consumed: ∞'. Add EASTER EGG: Hidden Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) that triggers 'matrix mode' with green code rain falling over scene.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":6},{"description":"Add comprehensive SERVICES section showcasing: Custom Character Modeling, Game-Ready Asset Creation, Rigging & Animation, Unreal Engine Integration, Technical Art Consultation.

Import useGLTF from @react-three/drei and load '/meow.gltf'. Replace both the wireframe and solid icosahedron meshes with the loaded GLTF model using primitive component. Keep the same rotation animations and scroll-based effects. Position the model at [0, 0, 0] with scale starting at 1.5 (adjust if needed). Maintain the terminal green color scheme - apply emissive material with terminal green color to the model. Keep the Float animation and all existing lighting.

Since the .gltf file requires external dependencies (meow.bin and emissive.png) that aren't available, revert to using the wireframe character image at /wireframe-character.png as the main 3D centerpiece. Remove the MEOW model component and GLB loading code. Ensure the wireframe character image is prominently displayed in the hero section with the floating animation, glow effects, and scan-line overlay.
