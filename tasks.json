The 3D wireframe should progressively fill with texture/color as user scrolls. Add parallax effect with wireframe rotating on Y-axis during scroll. Include custom neon green crosshair cursor, floating particle system with green code snippets/vertices in background. Update hero text to: 'PHILLMODS - Innovative 3D Modeling & Animation - Ready for the Metaverse'. Add glowing green outlined 'COMMISSION TODAY' button with subtle pulse animation.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":3},{"description":"ACT 2 - THE CREATIVE VOID: Transform project section into floating 'Project Capsules' drifting through space at varying depths and speeds. Each capsule should use glass-morphism design containing: rotating 3D model preview, project title in terminal green, tech specs like 'Blender | Unreal Engine | Game-Ready'. On hover: capsule slows rotation, enlarges 10%, green glow intensifies. On click: expand to full-screen modal with high-res rotating 3D viewer, wireframe toggle switch, project breakdown showing 'Polycount | Textures | Rigged'.

Add PROCESS VIEWER: Timeline slider showing model evolution from Concept Sketch → Blockout → Wireframe → Textured → Final Render that users can scrub through. Add REAL-TIME STATS DASHBOARD with live counters: 'Projects Completed: 47', 'Total Vertices Modeled: 2.4M', 'Coffee Consumed: ∞'. Add EASTER EGG: Hidden Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) that triggers 'matrix mode' with green code rain falling over scene.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":6},{"description":"Add comprehensive SERVICES section showcasing: Custom Character Modeling, Game-Ready Asset Creation, Rigging & Animation, Unreal Engine Integration, Technical Art Consultation.

Check the hero heading specifically and make sure it shows 'PHILMODS' correctly.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":9},{"description":"Replace the icosahedron geometry with the MEOW character 3D model. Import useGLTF from @react-three/drei and load '/meow.gltf'. Replace both the wireframe and solid icosahedron meshes with the loaded GLTF model using primitive component. Keep the same rotation animations and scroll-based effects. Position the model at [0, 0, 0] with scale starting at 1.5 (adjust if needed). Maintain the terminal green color scheme - apply emissive material with terminal green color to the model. Keep the Float animation and all existing lighting. Add useGLTF.preload('/meow.gltf') at the bottom of the file for optimization.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":10},{"description":"Fix the missing MEOW model issue. Since the .gltf file requires external dependencies (meow.bin and emissive.png) that aren't available, revert to using the wireframe character image at /wireframe-character.png as the main 3D centerpiece. Remove the MEOW model component and GLB loading code. Ensure the wireframe character image is prominently displayed in the hero section with the floating animation, glow effects, and scan-line overlay. Keep all the scrolling animations and terminal green aesthetic. Make the wireframe character the star of the show - scale it appropriately and ensure it's clearly visible with the holographic effects.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":11},{"description":"Polish the entire site experience. Ensure smooth scrolling performance, verify all sections are properly spaced, check that the project capsules are clickable and display correctly in modals, confirm the Status beacon is visible and functional, test the Konami code easter egg works, verify the contact form and social links are working, and ensure the overall aesthetic is cohesive with the terminal green and void purple theme throughout.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":12},{"description":"Replace the current hero centerpiece with the full 3D MEOW character model. Import useGLTF from @react-three/drei and load '/meow.gltf' (all dependencies are now in public: meow.gltf, meow.bin, emissive.png). Create a MeowCharacter component that loads the model with primitive object. Position at [0, 0, 0] with scale 0.8 to start (may need adjustment). Add Float animation with speed 1.5, rotationIntensity 0.3, floatIntensity 0.5. Add scroll-based rotation on Y-axis. Wrap in Suspense with a loading fallback. Keep the terminal green lighting focused on the model with pointLights. Add useGLTF.preload('/meow.gltf'). Replace the wireframe shape in the hero section with this full 3D model.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":13},{"description":"Optimize the 3D model presentation. Ensure proper camera positioning to frame the character nicely. Add additional lighting: spotlight from above at [0, 8, 5] with intensity 2 and terminal green color, rim light from behind at [0, 2, -5] with intensity 1. If the model appears too dark, increase ambient light to 0.6. If scale needs adjustment for visibility, try values between 0.5 and 1.5.

Change the project descriptions to be more creative, interactive, and forward-looking. For example, instead of generic tech specs, add engaging placeholder text like 'More coming soon...', 'Watch this space evolve', 'Project details loading...', or 'Stay tuned for the full story'. Make the tone playful and hint that exciting project details will be added in the future. Keep the project titles (Goat Character V1, Environment Pack, Character Rigging Demo, Unreal Engine Real-Time Rendering) but make the descriptions feel alive and anticipatory rather than static.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":17},{"description":"Add an interactive empty state or 'Coming Soon' visual element to some project capsules. Maybe add a pulsing 'Work in Progress' indicator or animated placeholder that shows this portfolio is actively being built. Make it feel like a living, evolving showcase rather than a finished static gallery. Use creative copy like 'Loading creativity...', 'Building something amazing...', or 'New projects materializing...' Keep the pink and purple aesthetic with animated elements.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":18},{"description":"Remove the real-time stats dashboard that shows 'Projects Completed: 47', 'Total Vertices Modeled: 2.4M', 'Coffee Consumed: ∞'. Delete this entire section from the site.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":19},{"description":"Add a playful pink wireframe rat that runs across the screen as the user scrolls. Create a small 3D rat mesh using Three.js geometry (combine spheres and cylinders for body, head, tail, legs). Apply pink wireframe material (#ff41b4). Animate the rat to run from left to right across the screen when user scrolls past a certain point (maybe around 50% scroll). Add running animation by moving legs and bobbing body. Position it so it runs across the viewport at mid-screen height. Make it disappear off screen after crossing. Add subtle squeak sound effect if possible or just visual comedy. This is for comic relief and personality!","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":20},{"description":"Fix the pink wireframe rat so it's clearly visible. Ensure the rat appears on screen when scrolling. Increase the size of the rat (make it bigger, maybe 150-200px tall), ensure it has proper z-index to appear above all content, make the animation slower so it's easier to see, and position it at a clear viewport position (maybe vertical center of screen). Change the scroll trigger to activate earlier (around 30% scroll instead of 50%) and make the animation last longer (maybe 4-5 seconds instead of quick). Add a pink glow/shadow to make it pop against the dark background. Test that it's actually rendering and visible.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":21},{"description":"Reposition the pink wireframe rat as a contextual easter egg that appears at a meaningful moment during scroll. Instead of appearing at a random percentage, make it appear between major sections - like running across the screen right after the user scrolls past the project capsules section and before the services/about section. This makes it feel like the rat is 'inspecting the work' or 'delivering creative energy' between sections. Adjust the scroll trigger to detect when user is in the transition zone between Projects and Services sections. Make it feel like a delightful surprise that fits the narrative flow of the portfolio.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":22}]
